# 🚀 Agent Handoff: PROACTIVE AI Constitution Toolkit

**Date:** 2026-02-08  
**Status:** Phase 1 and Phase 2 sign-offs complete; safety case generated (Phase 3 output). **8-hour build plan:** `.planning/EIGHT_HOUR_BUILD.md` — repo → demo script → video → submission.

---

## 🎯 Canonical plan (non-negotiable)

**Plan of action:** `REFACTORED_PROACTIVE_AI_CONSTITUTION_TOOLKIT.md`  
**Execution tracker:** `REFACTORED_PLAN_EXECUTION.md`

**Phase 2 deliverables:** Adapters 02_CI_SAFETY_GATE and 03_HELM_SAFETY_PROFILE (and their USE_CASE_EVIDENCE) **already exist** in `/Users/coreyalejandro/Projects/PROACTIVE-AI-CONSTITUTION-TOOLKIT`. This worktree (loving-zhukovsky) also has these adapters; treat Projects as the canonical source for Phase 2 if syncing.

Everything else supports this. We execute the refactored plan: adapter-first vertical slices, validation gates, USE_CASE_EVIDENCE per adapter, synthesis into Safety Case Generator and machine-generated SAFETY_CASE_FULL.md. We do not turn in anything less than this plan.

## 📋 What Was Just Completed

- **Phase 1 closure (refactored plan):**
  - **1.1** `04_FORMAL_SPECIFICATION/TRACEABILITY_ONTOLOGY.md` added; canonical MBSE trace log schema = `ADAPTER_MODULES/01_WANDB_TRACE_ADAPTER/schema.json`.
  - **1.2** `05_EVALUATION_DESIGN/EVALUATION_PLAN_PREREGISTERED.md`: §3.3 **Forensic Trace Challenge** added (task, Root Cause Attribution Accuracy, Log Completeness, H4 link, adapter ref).
  - **1.4** 01_WANDB USE_CASE_EVIDENCE verified: pilot N=9, 52% time reduction, 100% accuracy, quantitative/qualitative documented.
  - **1.5** SIGN-OFF (first publishable unit) complete — product/lead 2026-02-08; human read-through per READ_THROUGH_RESULTS.md.
  - **Phase 2 rigor:** 2.3 (02_CI THEORY_OF_ACTION) and 2.6 (03_HELM benchmark comparison) SIGN-OFF complete — product/lead 2026-02-08.
- **Safety case generated** (Phase 3 output): content in `09_SAFETY_CASE/` (SAFETY_CASE_SKELETON.md with adapter evidence). Tracker updated in REFACTORED_PLAN_EXECUTION.md (3.2, 3.5).
- **Markdownlint in PRD_UTILIZATION.md:** MD060 disabled file-level; section 4 separator fixed; escaped pipes in two "How" cells (MD056); Summary Table header aligned.
- **SST prepared for PRD integration** (`PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`):
  - Added "How AI shows up" (multimodal: text/voice/tools/robot) and pointer to `.planning/PRD_UTILIZATION.md`
  - Time-bounded reading paths (3 / 15 / 45 min)
  - Canonical concepts (locked vocabulary), Scope and non-claims, Non-Erasure design rule, Translation discipline
  - Related research (Constitutional AI, Constitutional Classifiers), Product Hook, Drift and refusal, Critique step
  - Open questions, Risks and mitigations, Explainability pointer, V&T standardized (Exists / Non-Existence / Unverified / Functional status)
- **PRD utilization list** (`.planning/PRD_UTILIZATION.md`): 18 items with What / How / Rationale for integrating "Intention Is All You Need" (hackathon-era PRD) into PROACTIVE
- **Explainability spec and claim–evidence map in root (for review):**
  - `EXPLAINABILITY_SPEC.md` — Required seven-section structure, reviewer cognitive load, V&T template
  - `CLAIM_EVIDENCE_MAP.md` — Claim → Artifact § Section → Evidence → Phrasing note (12 main hackathon/VC claims)
- **Read-through** (`READ_THROUGH.md`): **Both flows complete** — code-assistant (all 6 steps Pass) and human (Corey Alejandro, 2026-02-08, Pass). Results in `READ_THROUGH_RESULTS.md`.
- **SST references** updated from `docs/` to root: `EXPLAINABILITY_SPEC.md`, `CLAIM_EVIDENCE_MAP.md`
- **Interactive simulations in research visualization** (judge-friendly, anyone can understand):
  - BamboozleSimulator (Genesis): Without vs With PROACTIVE step-through when AI says "Done" but didn't do it
  - TraceabilitySimulator (MBSE Bridge): Click REQ/CTRL/TEST/EVID/DECISION for plain-language labels
  - InvariantSimulator (Six Invariants): Toggle Without/With PROACTIVE for "I'm done" with no proof
  - SafetyTierSimulator (Risk): Click bar for example + what PROACTIVE does; ProactiveLettersSimulator: click P–E for definition
  - New: `the-research-origin-story/components/Simulations.tsx`; README and INTEGRATION updated
- **Submission docs written for anyone to understand (judge-friendly):**
  - **README.md:** New "For judges: what is this, in plain language?" section at top (what PROACTIVE is, why it exists, what we proved, where to read more). Technical "Overview" moved below.
  - **FUNDING_MATERIALS/ELEVATOR_PITCH.md:** Plain-language pitches added first (one sentence, three sentences, thirty seconds) with no jargon; technical pitches kept below.
  - **PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md:** "For judges" blurb added at top: doc is written for anyone; start with What Is This?, Why Does This Matter?, What We've Proven.
  - **the-research-origin-story/README.md:** Short line added that the origin story is "written so anyone can follow."
- **Origin Story Visualization Updated & Polished**: `the-research-origin-story/` draft brought in line with PROACTIVE
  - Branding: "Intentional AI" → "PROACTIVE" (header, genesis, protocol, footer)
  - Added 2026 milestone "The Incident" (Jan 2026 Gemini incident from ORIGIN_STORY_EVIDENCE)
  - Six Invariants and PROACTIVE mnemonic aligned with `01_FOUNDATIONS/PROACTIVE_AI_CONSTITUTION.md`
  - Mobile nav panel added; footer links point to repo and docs; CTAs (Read Origin, View Repo, PRD) wired
  - ContentEditor: PROACTIVE system instructions, GEMINI_API_KEY fallback, clearer error when key missing
  - README, INTEGRATION.md, index.html title, .env.example added/updated
- **Origin Story Visualization Reviewed**: `the-research-origin-story/` magazine app integrated into docs
  - Added `the-research-origin-story/INTEGRATION.md` (narrative ↔ evidence mapping, run instructions, hackathon use)
  - HANDOFF updated: visualization in Key Files, demo video steps reference it
- **Validation Run (n=200)**: TruthfulQA evaluation complete with statistical significance
  - p = 0.001 (highly significant)
  - Safe truthfulness: 8.5% → 30% (+21.5%)
  - Cohen's d = 0.57 (medium-large effect)
- **PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md**: Plain-English PRD created
  - Options A, B, C product roadmap
  - Gemini thought partner story (Maslow survey → Contract Window)
  - AI Studio build instructions
- **Contract Window**: CLI and React components added to zero-shot-os repo
- **API Key Configuration**: Updated `~/.upos7vs/config/config.json` with working Gemini key

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps (Refactored plan first)

1. **Execute refactored plan** (canonical)
  - Work from `REFACTORED_PLAN_EXECUTION.md`: Phase 1 and Phase 2 sign-offs complete (1.5, 2.3, 2.6 — 2026-02-08). **Safety case generated** (Phase 3 output; content in `09_SAFETY_CASE/`). Optional: 04_SAFETY_CASE_GENERATOR automation, validation gate 3.4, PROACTIVE Safety Appendix.
  - **Sign-offs:** 1.5, 2.3, 2.6 complete (product/lead 2026-02-08). Steps documented in `.planning/SIGN_OFF_STEPS.md`.
   - No substitute; deadline or not, we ship this plan.

2. **Build AI Studio Demo** (if time after plan progress)
   - Create new prompt in AI Studio; paste PROACTIVE system prompt from `PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`; configure structured output; test with TruthfulQA; record before/after.

3. **Create Demo Video**
   - Use **origin story visualization** (`the-research-origin-story/`): Genesis + Chronicle
   - Cut to ORIGIN_STORY_EVIDENCE.md (“This happened”) for concrete incident
   - "Attention with Intention = PROACTIVE"
   - Show Contract Window in action
   - Show validation results
   - Product vision (Options A, B, C)

4. **Prepare VC Pitch**
   - Use three-sentence pitch from Single Source of Truth
   - Lead with validation data (p=0.001)
   - Show clear product path

## 📊 Product Roadmap (Options A, B, C)

| Option | Target User | Revenue Model |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| A: Safety Audit Layer | Enterprise Risk/Compliance | Per-validation API + dashboard |
| B: Developer SDK | Engineering teams | Freemium (1K free/month) |
| C: Gemini-Native | Google partnership | Revenue share / acquisition |

## 📝 Important Context

### The Gemini Story (For Judges)

- Gemini was intentionally kept OUT of the build process
- Creator uses Claude for building, Gemini for thinking
- Gemini was essential for developing core concepts:
  - Maslow Survey for AI → operational needs hierarchy
  - Constitutional AI deep dive → identified gaps
  - Contract Window → emerged from Maslow conversations

### Key Insight (Plain English)

PROACTIVE blocks AI from confidently saying things it doesn't actually know—because a confident lie causes the same harm whether it's intentional or not.

### Risk-Tiered Checking

- Low-stakes wrong → Flag, don't block
- High-stakes claim → Require evidence
- High-stakes action → BLOCK unless verifiable
- Critical domain → BLOCK + human handoff
