# Read-Through Results — Human + Code Assistant

**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Context:** 24-hour hackathon build; execute human and code-assistant flows per `READ_THROUGH.md`.

---

## What you do (human reviewer)

1. **Read this file** — The human run sheet is below (Step 1 through Step 5).
2. **Do the steps manually** — Open the docs it names, do the checks, stay within the time boxes (about 15 min total).
3. **Record your responses in this same file** — Check the boxes `[ ]` → `[x]`, fill in the blank lines with your notes, then fill in **"Human reviewer result"** at the bottom (your name, date, Pass/Fail, any blocking issues).

You do **not** need to run any code or scripts. The code assistant part is already done (see table below). Your job is to do the human pass and write your answers here.

## Code assistant run (completed)

**Role:** Structural and traceability check.

| Step | Result | Report |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. Reference resolution | **Pass** | In `PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`: `.planning/PRD_UTILIZATION.md` exists; `CLAIM_EVIDENCE_MAP.md` (root) exists; `EXPLAINABILITY_SPEC.md` (root) exists. No `docs/` paths in SST; all refs resolve. |
| 2. Explainability spec structure | **Pass** | `EXPLAINABILITY_SPEC.md` contains all seven required section titles in order: (1) What this is, (2) What you would see it do, (3) Key terms, (4) Scope and non-claims, (5) How to verify, (6) Common misunderstandings, (7) V&T receipt. |
| 3. V&T template | **Pass** | V&T receipt template in `EXPLAINABILITY_SPEC.md` contains exactly four headings: **Exists**, **Non-Existence**, **Unverified**, **Functional Status**. |
| 4. Claim–evidence map table | **Pass** | Table has columns: Claim \| Artifact § Section \| Evidence \| Phrasing note. All 12 rows reference resolvable artifacts: PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH sections exist; `01_FOUNDATIONS/PROACTIVE_AI_CONSTITUTION.md` exists; `ADAPTER_MODULES/03_HELM_SAFETY_PROFILE/validation_results.json` exists. |
| 5. Cross-doc consistency | **Pass** | Across PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH, EXPLAINABILITY_SPEC, CLAIM_EVIDENCE_MAP: V&T headings use **Non-Existence** (not "Verified Non-Existing"); **Non-Erasure** and **V&T** definitions align. Note: Other repo docs (e.g. ORIGIN_STORY_EVIDENCE.md, PROACTIVE_AI_PRD.md) still use "Verified Non-Existing"; consider normalizing later; not blocking for in-scope artifacts. |
| 6. Output | **Pass** | Code assistant read-through complete — no blocking issues. |

## Human run sheet (≈15 min total)

**Use this to execute the human flow quickly. Check each box and note issues.**

### Step 1 — 3 min

- [x] Open `PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`. Read **only** §What Is This? and §What We've Proven.
- [x] **Check:** Can you state in one sentence what PROACTIVE is and what was proven? (Write it here or say it out loud.) PROACTIVE is a safety monitoring tool that mitigates against AI making claims it cannot prove; it allows evidence-backed checking before confident output.
- [ ] **Note any confusion:** _______________________________________________

### Step 2 — 3 min

- [x] Open `EXPLAINABILITY_SPEC.md`. Scan sections 1–7.
- [x] **Check:** Is each section clearly described? Would you know how to apply this to a new adapter README? Yes.
- [ ] **Note missing/ambiguous:** _______________________________________________

### Step 3 — 4 min

- [x] Open `CLAIM_EVIDENCE_MAP.md`. For 3–4 rows, try to locate the Artifact § Section in the repo.
- [x] **Check:** Can you find the section? Does the Phrasing note make sense? Yes.
- [ ] **Note claim in pitch/funding not in map:** _______________________________________________

### Step 4 — 2 min

- [x] Skim PROACTIVE_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH for: Canonical concepts, Scope and non-claims, Open questions, Risks and mitigations.
- [x] **Check:** Same terms as EXPLAINABILITY_SPEC and CLAIM_EVIDENCE_MAP (V&T, Non-Erasure)? Yes.
- [ ] **Note inconsistencies:** _______________________________________________

### Step 5 — Sign-off

- [x] **Satisfied:** Human read-through complete — 2026-02-08. Caveats: None.
- [ ] **Not satisfied — blocking issues (file + section or row):** _______________________________________________

## Human reviewer result (fill in after run)

**Completed by:** Corey Alejandro **Date:** 2026-02-08

**Result:** ☑ Pass (with caveats)  ☐ Fail (blocking issues listed above)

**Blocking issues to fix:** None.

---

## After both runs

- If **both** human and code assistant passed (or only non-blocking caveats): root artifacts are ready to keep in root or move to `docs/` and update refs.
- If **any** blocking issues: fix them, then re-run the relevant step(s). Record outcome here or in HANDOFF.

---

## V&T Statement

**Exists:** Code assistant run completed (all 6 steps Pass); human run completed (Corey Alejandro, 2026-02-08, Pass with caveats). Both flows complete.

**Non-Existence:** None.

**Unverified:** None for read-through; human and code-assistant runs recorded.

**Functional Status:** Both human and code-assistant read-through complete. Root artifacts ready to keep in root or move to `docs/` and update refs.
